        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Why Music Matters to Me</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Music has most likely been the most influential source on my entire life. From listening to it, to playing it, and even to writing it on occasion, it has shaped me into the person I am today.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Band and music has always been like a second family for me, always there to comfort me and guide me through even the darkest of times. I've also found that I have a lot of natural talent when it comes to music, allowing myself to really express myself and be creative, especially through jazz improvisation, which I still suck at but I'm slowly improving. And being a very competitive person by nature I greatly enjoyed competing at the region/area/state level in Texas, which is considered to be the most competitive and difficult state for music.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>My Journey</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>I started out doing choir here and there as a little kid, eventually picking up the saxophone in 5th grade because I wanted to be like my cousin at the time who I looked up to. I then joined band when I moved to Texas halfway through 5th grade, which is where my true love for music began. I joined the jazz band in 8th grade and I immediately fell in love with it the moment I joined. I then joined marching band in high school as well as the higher level concert bands and jazz ensembles, with marching practices almost everyday after school until the early evenings and traveling on the weekends to competitions. I climbed through the ranks, landing in the top concert band my sophmore year, becoming principal player my junior year, and making the top jazz ensemble my senior year. I am now continuing my studies in jazz here at Gonzaga and plan on continuing anywhere that I can play.</p>
